                    <h2>Reasons why you aren't building muscle correctly</h2>
                    <p>It's normal to struggle with muscle building especially when you are unsure of the information around you,
                        wheather or not they are true or false. Here's how to build them the right way.
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <h3>You are not eating enough</h3>
                            <p>If you are not a beginner and you are not eating in a calorie surplus, you won't gain any appreciable amount of muscle.
                                Protein is the bulding block for muscle.If your protein is inadequete, your muscle building will be limited.You need 0.8-2 grams of protein per body mass.</p>
                        </li>
                       

                        <li>
                            <h3>You are not following a routine</h3>
                            <p>Make sure that you are following a routine that is geared to your experience level and goals that consist of progressive overload.
                                You should be doing research so you will know what workouts you should be doing,instead of walking around aimlessly. You need to be consistant to see results.</p>

                        </li>
                        <li><h3>You are not training hard enough</h3>
                            <p>You need to train to failure not being 1-2 or more reps close to failure. Muscle grows from the stress you place on them. You should be training for hypertrophy while doing 6-12 reps.</p>

                        </li>
