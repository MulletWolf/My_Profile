                    <h2>Bigger, Stronger</h2>
                    <p>My name is Diana Ogualiri, founder of Mysterra. 
                        I started this company seven years ago because 
                        I wanted many people to achieve their fitness goals.
                        Becoming a Personal Trainer was a natural choice for me as I am passionate about healthy living and sharing my expertise and knowledge with people.
                         Here's how we have been doing it :</p>

                         <h2>Struggles seen</h2>
                         <p>A lot of people were struggling to find a personal trainer who listened , creates a friendly environment to talk about non-training topics and knew enough to weed out the misinformation.</p>
                         <p>This problem caused a mistrust of personal trainers to occur, which led people to be constantly misinformed online as a result. Many personal trainers teach complicated exercises that can't be done without supervision.</p>
                         <p>Not ours! We make sure our personal trainers create regimens that are easy for our clients to understand. Real personal training is teaching lifetime habits so they can eventually progress on their own. This is what our personal trainers were trained to do .
